#####File names
Filename should be in lowercase with "_" to separate words in the name and "-" to separate type of the file (service, controller etc.).
Eg. user-service.ts, user_role-service.ts, user_login_logout-service.ts

2. public/static variables - camelCase
3. constants - ALL\_CAPS 
4. methods - camelCase
